3.

## rank for each user so that we could know which record indicates the last visit

select site_id,count(*) as number_of_users

4. 
with first_visit as(

## The difference is that order the date by ascending way

select sum(case when l.site_id = f.site_id then 1 else 0 end)
from first_visit f,last_visit l 
where l.rank_1 = 1 and f.rank_2 = 1 and l.user_id = f.user_id

## The motivation is to generate a new table containing columns for showing the customer's first and last visit
